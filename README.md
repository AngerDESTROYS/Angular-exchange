# [DEMO](https://angerdestroys.github.io/angular-exchange/)
# AngularExchange
This Angular application fetches and displays today's exchange rates from the PrivatBank API archive. It also includes a currency converter to convert between different 7 currencies.
Also, I added a button to swap currency names from selects and to take a number from the second input to the first and recount the second input to see what u will get from selling that currency.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

## Features
- Display today's exchange rates from the PrivatBank API archive
- Currency converter supporting 7 different currencies
- Swap currency names and calculate values with a button

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
